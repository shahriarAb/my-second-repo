        <h3 class="header-title">Have fun in Sajek Valley.</h3>
        <small>Author: <span class="author-name">Mohammad Ghuraghuri Uddin</span></small>
        <p>Sajek is a union located in the north of Chittagong Hill Tracts. It's under Baghaichori Upazila in Rangamati hill district, it is situated 67 kilometres (42 mi) north-east from Khagrachhari town and 95 kilometres (59 mi) north from Rangamati city.</p>
        <p>You can visit Sajek Valley by reserving Jeep Gari/Chander Gari from Khagrachari. It will cost you BDT 8000 to 10000 with the returning fare. It is perfect for 12 to 15 people. But if you are in a small group, then join with another group to reduce the cost.As the deep clouds & sudden rain on the valley is the key attraction, so the rainy season is the best time to travel Sajek Valley. Mostly from the beginning of June to the end of September is the best time. But you can visit Sajek all around the year.</p>
